    "## Project overview\n",
    "Customer support chatbot prototype for ShopUNow that combines curated FAQs with LangChain/LangGraph to route and answer employee/customer questions.\n",
    "- Uses domain-specific FAQs across HR, IT support, facilities/admin, billing/payment, and shipping/delivery as the retrieval corpus.\n",
    "- Normalizes each FAQ into LangChain `Document` objects and stores embeddings in an in-memory Qdrant vector store for fast semantic search.\n",
    "- Classifies incoming questions by department and sentiment, then chooses between RAG-generated replies or escalation flows.\n",
    "- Streams a LangGraph state machine that chains categorization, sentiment analysis, retrieval-augmented response, and optional on-call escalation.\n",
    "- Designed for notebook experimentation; `OPENAI_API_KEY` is loaded from `.env`, Qdrant is created in memory, and widgets collect escalation details when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook map\n",
    "- Setup: sample FAQ corpora per department, env loading, imports.\n",
    "- Data prep: convert FAQ entries to `Document` objects with department metadata.\n",
    "- Vector store: embed FAQs with `OpenAIEmbeddings` and ingest into Qdrant via `QdrantManager` helper.\n",
    "- Agent logic: LangGraph nodes for classification, sentiment, retrieval-based response, and escalation form handling.\n",
    "- Driver: `call_support_agent` streams events and renders the final Markdown answer.\n"
